# SyslogAnalytics
This is my System Log Analytics script set for analyzing the collected RSyslog data that was generated by the DNSmasq and other components along my network.

In the Folder [grafana](grafana/), there are ready to use Grafana Dashboards.

Prerequisite: Existing PostgreSQL connection named "Syslog" to the RSyslog database that should be analyzed.

In the folder [postgres](postgres/) I have put one setup sql file for autocreating daily partitions. 
Since the logging can be quite extensive, I have added a function in the trigger to also drop a partition once older than 11 days, i.e., there will be only 10 days available for reporting.
